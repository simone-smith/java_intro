Disadvantage:
Slower and less efficient



* As an analogy to foreign languages, a compiler acts as a translator (say, someone who translates a book) and an interpreter acts like, well, an interpreter.

* While debugging programs, you wouldn't notice much of a difference between compilers and interpreters because the executable file needs to be regenerated whenever the source code changes.Â  However, once debugging is completed, an executable created by a compiler will run much faster than a similar piece of source code that always has to run through its interpreter. Using the analogy, reading a translation of a poem will always be "faster" than having to interpret the poem on the fly every time you read it.

* However, there are advantages to interpreted languages. In artificial intelligence, interpreted languages are preferred since programs may have to adapt to new stimuli. Also, it is generally easier to build a prototype program using an interpreter. Many interpreted languages also provide a "compile mode" to create executables which will run about as fast as an executable created by a compiler.
