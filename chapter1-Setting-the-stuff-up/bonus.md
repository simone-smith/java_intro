Delve a little deeper, do some research, and find out what do the following mean:

`public` - any other class can access it

`class` - every line of code that can run needs to be inside a class

`static` - the method can be run without creating an instance of the parent class

`void` - the method doesn't return a value

`main` - the name of a method

`System` - a pre-defined class that Java provides us, which holds some useful methods and variables

`out` - a static variable within System that represents the output of the program (stdout)

`println` - a method of out that can be used to print a line
